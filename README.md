# InquirED Code Challenge

## Summary

```
npm install
npm start
```

## User Stories

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Redux
- Thunk
- React-hook-form

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to get familiar with Redux toolkit documentation, TypeScript, and form validation using react-hook-forms

## Areas for improvement

- Modularization

- Relying on component state for filter function created many issues for filtering by active

- Overall design and form validation could be elaborated on

###### To address this in the future, I intend to:

- Leverage the benefits of using redux selectors

- Utilize more component slices via redux toolkit

- Further extraction and modularization of component API
