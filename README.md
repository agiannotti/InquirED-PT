# InquirED Code Challenge

## Summary

```
npm install
npm start
```

## User Stories

## Features

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Redux
- Thunk
- React-hook-form

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to get familiar with redux toolkit documentation, thunk, and typescript typings, as well as form validation using rect-hook-forms

## Areas for improvement

- Modularization

- Relying on component state for filter function created many issues for filtering by active

###### To address this in the future, I intend to:

- Leverage the benefits of using redux selectors

- Utilize more component slices via redux toolkit

- Further extract and modularization of component API
